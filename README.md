# Personalsite (Web-Dev-Websites)

This contains the HTML and thew CSS code which  I used to structure my website and make it look like ![Sean Halpin](seanhalpin.design) (now archived)
Working on using JS to amplify this **attempt at a personal Website** and constant commits

I use the **Atom text editor for compiling and VSCode for testing out** 
Website is currently deployed at ![manjunathan.me](manjunathan.me)
