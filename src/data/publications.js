      description: "This research leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for semi-supervised learning to predict COVID-19 incidence across Indian states. By utilizing demographic data and state adjacency information, our approach achieved 85.3% accuracy in predicting pandemic spread patterns. The paper discusses the model architecture, training methodology, and implications for pandemic preparedness.",

      title: "Real-time Ship Detection and Localization in SAR Images using Artificial Intelligence",
      authors: "Manjunathan R, Krishi V, Bharath Vishal G",
      conference: "5th National Industry Innovators Meet, IETE Achievements",
      location: "IETE Delhi, India",
      date: "2022",
      description: "This paper presents a novel approach to detect and localize ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using a modified YOLOv3 architecture. Our method achieves 81.02% mAP and near 100% accuracy in element detection with optimized FPS, making it suitable for real-time maritime surveillance applications. The approach is robust against adverse weather conditions and varying lighting conditions.",
